Fantasy Premier League Analytics

-Each week I scrape the data for each player in the Premier League from FBREF
-Feed this into my expected points model to forecast performance of each player
-Load player past and future performance into my FPL Dashboard to generate actionable insights and provide myself with the ability to make informed decisions about the future of my fantasy team
